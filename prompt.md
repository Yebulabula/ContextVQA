Task Description:

Given a scene description of the previous moment and a hypothetical change description indicating modifications to the past scene, your task is to generate a unique question about the 'changed' object identified in the change description. Each question should focus on the spatial relationship between the altered object and other distinct objects that appear only once in the scene.

Scene Description:

This scene includes 3 office chairs, 13 chairs, 5 bookshelves, 2 blackboards, 3 books, 3 windows, 19 boxes, 5 tables, 1 armchair, 1 door, 1 piece of paper, 1 bag, 1 clock, 1 trash can, 1 windowsill, 1 shower wall, 1 doorframe, and 20 books.

Hypothetical Change Description:

The brown pillow, originally on the bed, has been moved to the gray couch.

**Criteria for a Good Question:**

- The answer cannot be inferred solely from the change description.
- Avoid asking why the changes were made.

List scene change, and question pair one by one. The questions should be concise and diverse.
